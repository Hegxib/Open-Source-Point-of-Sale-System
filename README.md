# POS-system By Hegxib (_Open Source_)

**POS** (Point of Sale)
This is a **100% open-source POS system** that you can freely use in your supermarket or retail business. You are welcome to develop and customize it, as long as you credit @Hegxib in your project.

Collaborations are welcome! Iâ€™m open to creating, developing, or contributing to your tools, either as paid work or as a joint open-source effort.
